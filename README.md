## Description
_A simple MVC page, created for Epicodus Coding School to practice/show knowledge of basic database management, utilizing a many-to-many relationship and join table

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone/download from GitHub (unzip, if necessary)_
* _Open terminal, navigate to the `Factory` directory, inside the `Factory.Solution` root directory_
* _Still in the terminal, enter `dotnet restore`._
* _Next, enter `dotnet build`_
* _Then, enter `dotnet run`_
* _Finally, in browser of choice, navigate to `http://localhost:5000`_

### Database Setup


* _First, download MySQL Workbench [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)_
* _After a successful install and setup, in the Administration tab, hit "Data Import/Restore", followed by clicking "Import from Self-Contained File", and navigate to the included `scott_oneil.sql` dump structure file_
* _Click "Start Import"_
* _Next, in the root directory of `Factory.Solution`, create a file called `appsettings.json` and input the following, with "YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE" being the password you set up with MySQL workbench:_
```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=scott_oneil;uid=root;pwd=[YOUR-PASSWORD-HERE];"
  }
}
```
* _Now, navigate back to the `Factory` directory, and update the database with the command `dotnet ef database update` in the terminal_
